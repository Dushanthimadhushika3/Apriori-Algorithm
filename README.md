# Apriori-Algorithm

Apriori is a relational database algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning. 
The basic process of the Apriori Algorithm is identifying the appearing of frequent individual items in the dataset and extending the item sets as long as they appear sufficiently often in the dataset. 
The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found.
